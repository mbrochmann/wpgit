Doing the wordpress tutorial here:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html

Just to see a different method.

Eventually, will sync the databases (or something like that).

Also, want to figure out the "bare-bones" way to store ONLY the parts of wordpress that make my configuration unique 
(i.e. the parts necessary to restore wordpress if my site is wiped out)
