Attempting to install the Password Protected plugin to localhost (avoiding using FTP)


Added the following to wp-config.php:
described at https://wpfortune.com/blog/wordpress-tips-tricks/install-plugins-localhost/

/* Added to install plugins on localhost */
define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');

Set permissions to 777 on wp-content

However, I get the following error in the GUI:
Installation failed: Could not create directory.

Note, a lot of related files show up in:
wp-content/upgrade/password-protected.2.0.3-T4I7pr/
(created by user _www)

"Installation failed" found in:
./wp-admin/includes/class-wp-automatic-updater.php

"Could not create directory" found in:
./wp-admin/includes/class-wp-upgrader.php

Then, it occured to me to try:

chmod 777 wp-content/plugins

and that did the trick. "Password Protected" plugin successfully installed.

I would prefer not to have to set the permissions to 777.
I could set it to 775, and add _www to group "staff" (current group of all the wordpress stuff)

Instead, as recommended here: https://coderwall.com/p/gl_grw/make-a-directory-writable-by-apache-in-mac-os-x-maverick

I changed wp-content and wp-content/plugins to 775 and changed the owner to _www. 

The group is still staff, so since I added group write access, I can still modify those files myself.
